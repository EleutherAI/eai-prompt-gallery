    "prompt": "In a shocking finding, scientist discovered a herd of unicorns living in a remote, previously unexplored valley, in the Andes Mountains. Even more surprising to the researchers was the fact that the unicorns spoke perfect English.",

Dr. Henshilwood and her colleagues have been studying the group for the past six years. During that time, the group has grown from one unicorn to 19 animals.",
